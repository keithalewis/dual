# Dual Numbers

Dual numbers let you compute derivative to machine precision.

The basic idea is that if there were a number &epsilon;&ne;0 with &epsilon;<sup>2</sup> = 0
then f(x + &epsilon;) = f(x) + f'(x)&epsilon;.

For example, (x + &epsilon;)<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>2</sup> + 2x&epsilon; so the derivative of
x<sup>2</sup> is 2x.
